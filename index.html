					<h1>BMW i8</h1>

					<p>The BMW i8 is no ordinary sports car. It’s an icon of progress — an extraordinary evolution of The Ultimate Driving Machine®. As a revolutionary plug-in hybrid, this sports car uses eDrive technology to combine the efficiency of an all-electric motor and the power of a TwinPower Turbo engine for an exhilarating driving experience that’s every bit BMW.</p>
					<p>At first glance, the BMW i8 comes across as a beautifully designed sports car. But it’s far more than that. Aerodynamics plays a key role in the design of the BMW i8, with each detail working toward channeling airflow for greater efficiency. Additionally, the streamflow design of the vehicle’s rear wing helps provide significant downforce all the way up to the electronically limited top speed of 155 mph.</p>
					<p>When a car looks this fast, it better live up to its appearance. The BMW i8 does just that, with help from its powerful, yet efficient TwinPower Turbo 3-cylinder combustion engine and its innovative electric motor. Together, these two engines work in tandem for uninterrupted acceleration from a standstill with a total system output of 420 lb-ft of torque and 357 horsepower. </p>
